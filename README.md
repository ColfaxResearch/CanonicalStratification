# CanonicalStratification

Library for canonical stratification of simplicial complexes.
This code is a companion to the publication "Algorithmic Stable Stratifications of Simplicial Complexes" ().

# Installation

There are no special module dependency for the core library.
However, "benchmark.py" requires `scipy` and `numpy` for producing Delaunay triangulation of 2-sphere and 3-ball.

To install:
	$ `pip install /path/to/install/dir`
